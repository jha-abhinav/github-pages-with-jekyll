Glad you wanna know about me.

I'm Abhinav Jha, a third year enrolled in the BSMS program at 
[IISER Tirupati](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Institute_of_Science_Education_and_Research).

I'm interested in stuff like Maths, Physics, Linux and a bit of programming languages.
My hobbies would be well watching anime, reading random stuff and looking at memes.
